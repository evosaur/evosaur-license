0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version BRUH of the Evosaur Project
Public License.

"Copyright" means copyright and copyright-like laws that apply to other
kinds of works.

"The Original Work" refers to any Copyrightable work licensed under This
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "You".  "Licensees" and
"Recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of a work in
a fashion requiring Copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "Covered Work" means either the unmodified Original Work or a work
based on The Original Work.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make You directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable Copyright law, except reading it,
compiling it (??) or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some juristictions other activities as well (bruh).


(clearly define compile sometime)

1. Source Code.

The "Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  "Object Code"  eans any non-Source Code
form of a work.

The "Corresponding Source", of a work in Object Code form, means all the
Source Code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
run the Object Code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
these activities.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
# Generation utilities license or in corresponding source?

The Corresponding Source for a work in Source Code form is that same
work. # WTF

2. Basic Permissions.

All permissions granted under this License are granted for the term of
Copyright on The Original Work, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.

This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
unmodified Work.  The output from running a Covered Work is covered by
this License if and only if the output, given its content, constitutes a
Covered Work.  

This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent,
as provided by Copyright law.  # bruh


# define run or use in context of a non-program
# l2 of \prev\par: "the Work" or "The Original Work" or what

You may make and run Covered Works without conditions so long as your
license otherwise remains in force.

You may propogate convered works to others for the sole purpose of
having them make modifications exclusively for You, or provide You with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in propogating all material for which you do not
control Copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
Copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
# "your" copyrighted material?
# wtf is this even for

3. I don't know how to name this.

No Covered Work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling oblications under article 11
of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws probibiting or restricting cirvumvention of such measures.

When you propogate a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
Covered Work, and You disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, you or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

# from now on "conveying" is reintroduced, fix section 0--3

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
